## Dev TODO list

- How to integrate React w/ Django? After we figure that out, we can start scaffolding our project.
    - [This tutorial](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/tutorial-api-django-rest-react/#Django_REST_with_React_Django_and_React_together) to set React's built src file under Django (or even the react project folder under django).
        - There're some problems, like servig static files. You can bundle frontend into a html and js file. But You still have to load that js as a static resources, and you have to place that `{% static ... %}` in, which is not auto-generated by `npm build`.
    - **Or use saperate repo for django and react.** <-- Seems like a mich cleaner way to do this.
