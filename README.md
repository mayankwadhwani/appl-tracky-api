# appl-tracky
An Application Tracking System to help job finders ease their out-of-control spreadsheet use tracking every job application record.

## Dev TODO list

1. How to integrate React w/ Django? After we figure that out, we can start scaffolding our project.
    - [This tutorial](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/tutorial-api-django-rest-react/#Django_REST_with_React_Django_and_React_together) to set React's built src file under Django (or even the react project folder under django).
        - There're some problems, like servig static files. You can bundle frontend into a html and js file. But You still have to load that js as a static resources, and you have to place that `{% static ... %}` in, which is not auto-generated by `npm build`.
    - **Or use saperate repo for django and react.** <-- Seems like a mich cleaner way to do this.
1. Scaffold Django project.
1. Deploy production backend. Consider using Docker, and deploy on ECR, using our existing ECS cluster.
    - [Update aws container agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/agent-update-ecs-ami.html).
        - [SSH into a container](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance-connect.html)
        - [How to get a provate key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ecs.html#create-a-key-pair)
        - The public DNS is `ec2-107-22-157-134.compute-1.amazonaws.com`, and public IP is `107.22.157.134`. Now ssh to the container by `ssh -i path/to/pem ec2-user@107.22.157.134`
        - According to [this aws doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance-connect.html), "If you did not specify a key pair when you launched your instance, there is no way to connect to the instance."
        - What we will do: **create a new series of instance, task, service for this project (tracky) using some automation tool**. Then, use the same tool to re-create the bb backend container and related service/task. We will deal with CI/CD later.
            - ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ ðŸ”¥ **First we need to dockerize Django**. Docker for Django is quite complicate, as we have to setup Nginx, gunicorn, and basically a linux environment. [Follow this post](https://medium.com/@rohitkhatana/deploying-django-app-on-aws-ecs-using-docker-gunicorn-nginx-c90834f76e21).
            - Next: figure out how to use Terraform to create those resources.
    - Steps
        1. Create AWS resources by automation tool, perhaps terraform.
            - Try [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html).
        1. Develop a CI/CD process. You can just use AWS CodePipeline.
    - You want to checkout load balancer, or [follow steps in this SO answer to wire up subdomain by Route 53](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27336657/does-it-make-sense-to-have-an-amazon-elastic-load-balancer-with-just-one-ec2-ins).
